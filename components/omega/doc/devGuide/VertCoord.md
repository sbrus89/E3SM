## Vertical Coordinate

### Initialization

The default `VertCoord` instance is  created by the `init` method, which assumes that `Decomp` has already been initialized.
```
Decomp::init();
VertCoord::init();
```
The default instance can be retrieved by:
```
auto *DefVertCoord = VertCoord::getDefault();
```

Additional instances can be created by calling the `create` method.
```
VertCoord *VertCoord::create(const std::string &Name,  ///< [in] Name for vertical coordinate
                             const Decomp *MeshDecomp, ///< [in] Decomp for mesh
                             Config *Options)          ///< [in] Confiuration options
```
This calls the constructor and places the instance in a map that can be used to retrieve the instance by name:
```
auto *DefVertCoord = VertCoord::get('Name');
```
The constructor stores some information from `Decomp`, allocates the primary member variables that are computed by methods of the `VertCoord` class during a model timestep.
Host mirror copies are also created, with variables appended with `H`.
It also reads in some additional mesh information and computes the information describing the min/max location of the active vertical layers.
Finally, it registers variables with `IOStreams` so they can be requested as output.

### Removal

`VertCoord` instances can be removed by name:
```
VertCoord.erase("Name");
```
or all instances can be destroyed by calling:
```
VertCoord.clear();
```

### Use of hierarchical parallelism

The methods `computePressure` and `computeZHeight` are similar in that they use hierarchical parallelism to split the work for horizontal cells over teams of threads, with a `parallel_for`.
This is done with a `TeamPolicy`:
```c++
const auto Policy = TeamPolicy(NCellsAll, OMEGA_TEAMSIZE, 1);
```
The `parallel_for` is then called with this policy:
```c++
Kokkos::parallel_for("loopName", Policy, KOKKOS_LAMBDA(const TeamMember &Member) {
       const I4 ICell = Member.league_rank();
     ...
}
```
The cumulative sum in the vertical is computed among threads (in parallel) within in the `parallel_for` using  a `parallel_scan`.
The `parallel_scan` is called inside the `parallel_for`:
```c++
Range = KMax - KMin + 1;
Kokkos::parallel_scan(
    TeamThreadRange(Member, Range),
    [&](int K, Real &Accum, bool IsFinal) {
    ...
}
```
where `KMax` and `KMin` are the maximum and minimum active vertical layer indices.
In `computeTargetThickness` an outer loop divides the horizontal cells over teams of threads as above, however, there is a nested `parallel_reduce` that computes the column sum of the reference layer thicknesses times the vertical coordinate movement weights among threads in a team:
```c++
Real SumWh 0= 0;
Kokkos::parallel_reduce(
    Kokkos::TeamThreadRange(Member, KMin, KMax + 1),
    [=](const int K, Real &LocalWh) {
       LocalWh += VertCoordMovementWeights(ICell, K) *
                  RefLayerThickness(ICell, K);
    },
    SumWh);
```
also, the vertical computation of the target thicknesses are computed in a nested `parallel_for`:
```c++
Kokkos::parallel_for(
    Kokkos::TeamThreadRange(Member, NChunks), [&](const int KChunk) {
   ...
}
```
This `parallel_for` iterates over vertical chunks to facilitate vectorization on CPUs within in inner `for` loop over the vector length.
The vector length on GPUs is set to 1 to maximize parallelism.
The `computeGeopotential` method uses hierarchical parallelism in a very similar way to `computeTargetThickness`, except that it doesn't require a column sum.
It has an outer `parallel_for` that splits horizontal cells into teams and an inner `parallel_for` that does vertical computations in chunks.
